***SDF Design Document***

Current gearbox definition in SDF is confusing, limited and outdated.


### Requirements

1. Hopefully be able to parse definition without having to open documentation.

### Example

In this example,

~~~
<sdf version='1.5'>
  <model name="gearbox_test_model">
  </model>
</sdf>
~~~
