# Improved sensors and noise modelling in Gazebo
***Gazebo Design Document***

## Overview 

A triaxial magnetometer sensor measures the magnetic field strength (in Tesla) 
along three mutually orthogonal axes. It is frequently used to measure the 
Earth's magnetic field, and can be fused an IMU to estimate orientation.
 
## Requirements

The addition of a new sensor type ```MagnetometerSensor```
